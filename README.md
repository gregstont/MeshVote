  - join a poll session, where the user will join an existing poll session being hosted by another peer
  - host a poll session, where the user will define a set of questions to be asked to other peers

### How to join a poll session
  -enter your user name on the loading screen and hit "join session". You will be brought to the "Join Session" browser where nearby poll session will appear:
